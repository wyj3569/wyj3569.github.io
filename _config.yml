  I'm currently a senior student in Pusan National University and my major is Computer Sciences and Engineering.

  I am interested in the convergence of computer networking and artificial intelligence,
  particularly in next-generation wireless communication and AIoT technologies. 
  
  I have experience working on IoT-related projects during my undergraduate and completed my graduation project
  using Wi-SUN FAN network.

  I would like to conduct research on applying artificial intelligence to communication, computer networking and IoT.

  Thank you for reading my self-introduction.

# Our team implemented a system named “IGO” that is tracking real-time indoor location and can call between medics and patients.

# It was implemented by various systems such as Android, Django and devices like Arduino and UWB.

# I was a software project manager and did back-end server programming.

# Our team got an excellence prize at this competition.

# This was a chance for me to learn more specific and practical knowledge of my major and could cultivate collaboration ability.

      I believe that it's important to take the right path, even if it takes a lot of time. 
      
      I'm someone who makes decisions very carefully, but once I've made a decision, I never give up and can work on it all day long. 
      
      Thank you for reading my CV.
